Guys, I've tried and I've failed. 
I tried to have the script create a file for me, but something is off and I ran the command bash and it wouldn't run. Now I've got to a point where my mind is done.
I have it saved and maybe we can get together and try to figure it out sometime soon if possible.
Below is the copy of what i've done:

#!/bin/bash

# Script:                               Creating Directories/Arrays              
# Author:                               Jose Cardozo           
# Date of latest revision:              11/10/2022
# Purpose:                              Learnining how to use arrays

# Review the process for creating a new directory.
# Create four directories using the script.

mkdir dir1
mkdir dir2
mkdir dir3
mkdir dir4

# Load each directory path into an array.

array=(dir1 dir2 dir3 dir4)

# create a new .txt file within each directory by referencing the directory with array indices, not the literal directory path.
# Test & validate.

touch /home/jusehcardozo/test/testfile1.txt
# Declare global variables
# files=("f1.txt" "f2.txt" "f3.txt" "f4.txt" "f5.txt")

# Declare functions

# Main
# echo ${files[4]}
# echo ${files[3]}
# echo ${files[2]}
# echo ${files[1]}
# echo ${files[0]}
